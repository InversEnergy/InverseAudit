    "content": "We’re so excited to release Just the Docs v0.4.0. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we’ve added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme. Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes . v0.4.0 contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we’d like to call out some of the most-requested changes: . | better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color | callouts, a new design component to highlight content | configuring mermaid.js, a markdown-native diagram visualization library | copy code button for code snippets | external navigation links | major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness | minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content) | modularized site components (advanced feature) | new custom includes: table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices | bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more! | more documentation for custom includes, this changelog, and the migration guide | . After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from v0.3.3. Using Release v0.4.0 . Unlike pre-releases, v0.4.0 is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be automatically upgraded to v0.4.0 the next time they build their site. To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot!

The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes.

These schedules are based on ASHRAE standards. For example, suppose we have an office building. The baseline is established using the calibrated model and typical operating schedules from Monday to Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. If the calibrated building operates longer than the baseline, the in operation score would be lower than 50. | Asset Score - Asset score is a metric that is similar to the miles-per-gallon (MPG) rating used for cars. It is based on a calibrated model and the building asset components required by ASHRAE Standard 90.1, which include roof and exterior wall insulations, windows U- and SHGC-values, and heating and cooling efficiencies. This model is known as an energy code baseline. | . Note: The scores are calculated using a weather-normalized model by replacing the actual weather data with TMY3. ",

    "content": "A model is calibrated with actual weather data representing the same time span as the measured interval data period. After the calibration, it is weather-normalized by replacing the actual weather data with normal weather data (TMY3: the typical meteorological year), which is called a Calibrated Baseline Model. The weather-normalized model is utilized throughout the whole energy analysis. Then two more types of models are created based on the Calibrated Baseline Model for the calculation of In Operation and Asset Scores: an Operation Normalized Baseline Model and an Energy Code Baseline Model. Calibrated Baseline Model is first created for all calculations using hourly interval data. Costs Savings After Retrofit is calculated from the difference in annual energy consumption from the post-retrofit model that is adjusted for the proposed ECMs (Energy Conservation Measures). Operation Normalized Baseline Model is used for the In Operation Score that needs an operation-based calculation of predicted energy savings. The Calibrated Baseline Mode’s calibrated schedules are replaced to reflect standardized operating conditions (the typical ASHRAE schedules) according to the building types. The difference between EUIs between the Calibrated Baseline Model and Operation Normalized Baseline Model is scored using the formula: In Operation Score = 100 - ( 50 x Calibrated Baseline EUI / Operation Normalised Baseline EUI) . Energy Code Baseline Model is simulated for the Building Asset Score that requires an asset-based calculation of predicted energy savings. The Calibrated Baseline Model’s input parameters are modified with asset properties required by the selected energy code . The difference in EUIs of the Calibrated Baseline and Energy Code Baseline Models is scored using the below formula: http://docs.inversenergy.com:8080/link/9#bkmrk-building-asset-score .

    "content": "Understanding kW and kWh in Interval Meter Data . Interval meter data typically presents energy consumption information in two key metrics: kilowatts (kW) and kilowatt-hours (kWh). Proper interpretation of these metrics is crucial for accurate energy analysis and billing. Definitions . | kW (kilowatt): A measure of power, representing the rate of energy consumption at a given moment. | kWh (kilowatt-hour): A measure of energy, representing the total amount of electricity consumed over a period of time. | . Data Conversion . When converting interval data to hourly figures: . | kW values are averaged to represent the mean power demand. | kWh values are summed to represent the total energy consumption. | . Critical Interpretation . Misinterpreting kW as kWh or vice versa can lead to significant errors in energy calculations: . If 30-minute kW intervals are mistakenly treated as kWh: . | Result: Annual energy consumption would be overestimated by 100%. The annual energy consumption would be calculated as double the actual amount (kWh). | . If 30-minute kWh intervals are mistakenly treated as kW: . | Result: Annual energy consumption would be underestimated by 50%. The estimated annual energy consumption would be 50% lower than the actual amount (kWh). | . These errors, when propagated over extended periods, can result in substantial discrepancies in energy analysis. Data Format for InverseAudit . InverseAudit supports two major data formats: Green Button and CSV. This manual outlines the specifications for each format and how they are handled by the system. Green Button Format . The Green Button is a standardized data format designed for easy and secure access to energy usage data. | Format: Standardized, machine-readable | Purpose: Allows utility customers to access their energy usage data in a consumer-friendly format | Handling: InverseAudit consumes Green Button data without any modification | . CSV (Comma-Separated Value) Format . CSV is a common output format for spreadsheet programs. InverseAudit supports two types of CSV formats and can automatically recognize the type. Horizontal CSV Format . | Structure: Horizontal header shows time, First column shows date | Default Unit: kW | Unit Specification: If needed, include “kWh” or “kW” in the first cell of the first column | File Extension: .csv | . Vertical CSV Format . InverseAudit supports two variations of the vertical format: . Two-Column Format . | Column 1: Date and time combined | Column 2: Electricity usage data | . Three-Column Format . | Column 1: Date | Column 2: Time | Column 3: Electricity usage data | . Data Import Process . InverseAudit automatically detects the format of the imported file (Green Button or CSV). For CSV files, the system determines whether it’s a horizontal or vertical format. The data is then processed according to the identified format. Best Practices . Ensure data consistency within each file For CSV files, maintain a clear structure as outlined above When using the horizontal CSV format, specify the unit (kW or kWh) if it differs from the default .
